![Project Banner](assets/poster.png)

---

## üöÄ Overview

This project is a **Web-Based Complaint Management System** developed as an individual assignment for the **Advanced API Development** module of the **IJSE - Graduate Diploma in Software Engineering (GDSE)** program.

The system is a full-stack application built using JSP, Servlets, and MySQL, following the MVC architecture. It allows users to manage complaints based on their roles (Employee or Admin), providing a streamlined process for complaint submission, tracking, and resolution.

### üìÖ Project Duration

- **Release Date:** 11th June 2025
- **Deadline:** 17th June 2025 (11:59 PM)

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- **Independent Application of JSP:** Demonstrate the ability to independently apply JSP technologies in building a full-stack web application.
- **HTTP Form Processing:** Design and implement robust HTTP form processing using GET and POST methods for data submission and retrieval.
- **MVC Architecture:** Apply the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to structure the application for modularity and maintainability.
- **Version Control & Documentation:** Maintain a clean and well-documented codebase using Git and provide comprehensive project documentation.
- **Technical Demonstration:** Deliver a clear and concise technical demonstration of the project, explaining its architecture and core functionalities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

### Functional Modules

#### 1. Authentication

- **User Login:** Secure user login with username and password.
- **Session Management:** Maintain user sessions to handle authentication state.
- **Role-Based Access Control:**
  - **Employee:** Can submit and manage their own complaints.
  - **Admin:** Has full access to manage all complaints and users.

#### 2. Complaint Management

**Employee:**

- **Submit Complaint:** Register a new complaint with a title and description.
- **View Complaints:** View a list of all complaints they have submitted.
- **Edit Complaint:** Modify the details of their own unresolved complaints.
- **Delete Complaint:** Remove their own unresolved complaints.

**Admin:**

- **View All Complaints:** Access a comprehensive list of all complaints in the system.
- **Update Complaint:** Modify the status (e.g., "Pending", "Resolved") and add administrative remarks to any complaint.
- **Delete Any Complaint:** Remove any complaint from the system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for client-side validation only)
- **Backend:** Jakarta EE (Servlets)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Database Connection Pooling:** Apache Commons DBCP
- **Web Server:** Apache Tomcat
- **Build Tool:** Apache Maven

### Constraints

- **No AJAX:** All server interactions are synchronous, using standard JSP form submissions (GET/POST).

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The application is built using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern to ensure a clear separation of concerns:

- **Model:** Represents the application's data and business logic.
  - **JavaBeans (DTOs):** `UserDTO`, `ComplaintDTO` for data transfer.
  - **DAO (Data Access Objects):** Handles all database operations, separating business logic from data persistence.
- **View:** Responsible for the user interface.
  - **JSP (JavaServer Pages):** Renders the UI and displays data to the user.
- **Controller:** Manages user input and application flow.
  - **Servlets:** Handle incoming HTTP requests, process user actions, and dispatch to the appropriate views.

### HTTP Method Usage

- **POST:** Used for all state-changing actions (Create, Update, Delete), such as submitting a complaint, updating its status, or deleting it.
- **GET:** Used for all read-only actions, such as viewing a list of complaints or navigating to a form page.

## üì¶ Setup and Configuration

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Java (JDK):** Version 21 or higher
- **Apache Maven:** Version 3.8 or higher
- **Apache Tomcat:** Version 11.0 or higher
- **MySQL Server:** Version 8.0 or higher

### 2. Database Setup

- Create a new database in MySQL named `cms`.
- Execute the SQL script located at `/db/schema.sql` to create the necessary tables (`users`, `complaints`).

### 3. Configuration

- The database connection details are hardcoded in the `DBCPDataSourceFactory.java` file.
  ```java
  // src/main/java/edu/cms/util/DBCPDataSourceFactory.java
  ds.setUrl("jdbc:mysql://root:1234@95.111.248.142:3306/cms");
  ds.setUsername("root");
  ds.setPassword("1234");
  ```
- **Update these values** to match your local MySQL server configuration if needed.

### 4. Build the Project

- Open a terminal in the project's root directory.
- Run the following Maven command to compile the code and package it into a WAR file:
  ```sh
  mvn clean install
  ```
- A `complaint-management-system.war` file will be generated in the `/target` directory.

### 5. Deployment

- Copy the generated `.war` file to the `webapps` directory of your Apache Tomcat installation.
- Start the Apache Tomcat server.
- The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/complaint-management-system/`.

## üìπ Video Demo

A 5-minute video demonstration of the project is required for submission. The video should cover:

- A brief overview of the project.
- A walkthrough of the core features for both Employee and Admin roles.
- An explanation of the project's architecture (MVC).
- A demonstration of how JSP forms are used to handle GET and POST requests.
